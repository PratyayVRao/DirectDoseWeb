                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The ICR is the amount of insulin you need for every certain amount of carbohydrates you eat. It helps
                  you figure out how much insulin to take with your meals.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong>Bolus Insulin:</strong> This is the extra insulin you take to cover the carbohydrates in your
                  meal. It's taken at the time of eating.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong>Basal Insulin:</strong> This is your background insulin that you take to keep your blood sugar
                  level steady throughout the day and night, even when you're not eating.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  To calculate ICR over a few days, you can look at your blood sugar patterns after meals. If you eat a
                  certain amount of carbs and give a certain amount of insulin, how much did your blood sugar go down?
                  Over time, by tracking this, you can find your personal ICR for different meals.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#006c67] mb-4">ISF (Insulin Sensitivity Factor)</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The ISF tells you how much 1 unit of insulin lowers your blood sugar. It's used when your blood sugar
                  is high, and you need to correct it by taking extra insulin.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  For example, if your ISF is 50, that means 1 unit of insulin will lower your blood sugar by 50 mg/dL.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  ISF is important because it helps you adjust your insulin when your blood sugar is above your target
                  range. The higher the ISF number, the more your blood sugar will drop for each unit of insulin you
                  take.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  You can calculate ISF by testing how much your blood sugar drops after taking a specific amount of
                  insulin. For example, if you take 1 unit of insulin and your blood sugar drops by 40 mg/dL, that would
                  be your ISF for that time.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Diabetes affects how the body processes sugar (glucose), which is the main energy source for cells. The
                key player in controlling blood sugar is insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas. Insulin helps glucose
                enter cells from the bloodstream. If there's too little insulin or the body can't use it properly, blood
                sugar levels rise, leading to diabetes.
              </p>

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>What happens?</strong> Blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be
                    called diabetes.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>Why?</strong> The body starts becoming resistant to insulin or the pancreas isn't making
                    enough insulin.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>Effect:</strong> If not managed, prediabetes can turn into Type 2 diabetes.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed italic">
                    Think of it like a traffic jamâ€”glucose tries to get into cells, but insulin isn't working as well,
                    so sugar gets stuck in the bloodstream.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>What happens?</strong> The immune system mistakenly destroys insulin-producing cells in the
                    pancreas.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>Why?</strong> This is an autoimmune diseaseâ€”your body attacks itself for unknown reasons.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>Effect:</strong> The pancreas stops making insulin completely, so glucose builds up in the
                    blood instead of going into cells.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their body makes none at all.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed italic">
                    Imagine a broken keyâ€”insulin is like the key that unlocks the door for glucose to enter cells. In
                    Type 1, the key is missing, so the sugar stays in the blood.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>What happens?</strong> The body still makes insulin, but cells stop responding to it.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>Why?</strong> Over time, lifestyle factors (like diet, lack of exercise, and genetics) can
                    make cells resistant to insulin. The pancreas tries to make more insulin but eventually wears out.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>Effect:</strong> Blood sugar stays too high, leading to complications over time.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    Managed with diet, exercise, medication, and sometimes insulin if the pancreas gets too weak.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed italic">
                    Think of it like a broken lockâ€”the key (insulin) is there, but the lock (cells) won't open properly,

                    <strong>What happens?</strong> Pregnancy hormones make the body more resistant to insulin.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>Why?</strong> The placenta releases hormones that help the baby grow but also block
                    insulin's effect. If the pancreas can't make extra insulin to compensate, blood sugar rises.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">
                    <strong>Effect:</strong> Usually disappears after pregnancy, but increases the risk of Type 2
                    diabetes later.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-2">

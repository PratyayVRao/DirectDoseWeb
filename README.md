# DirectDose

DirectDose is a web app that helps people with diabetes manage their insulin safely and efficiently. It provides accurate calculations for basal, prandial (meal-time), and insulin-to-carb ratio doses based on user input and nutritional data. The app prioritizes simplicity and accessibility, especially for lower-income and elderly individuals who may not have access to expensive glucose monitors or complex tracking systems.

## Purpose

DirectDose was inspired by a personal experience—its creator’s grandfather nearly lost his life to diabetic ketoacidosis after struggling with insulin management. The goal is to make reliable insulin tracking and education free and accessible to everyone, regardless of income or technical background.
